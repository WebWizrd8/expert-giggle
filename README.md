## Purpose

**A working demo usage of docker, docker-compose, mongodb, python3, docker-compose, mosquitto, swagger to serve as a demo**

The applications will run in parallel using docker-compose on different ports:

**1** [Random service](#random-service) generates random numbers and lists them (port 80)

**2** [CRUD service](#CRUD-service) Create, read, update and detele operations over a user collection (port 81)

**3** [MQTT service](#MQTT-service) will use a MQTT server (Mosquitto) to allow to publish sensor updates over MQTT  (port 1883)
The updates will be saved in mongodb (/demo/sensors). It will also compute a running average 
for each sensor and publish it to a separate topic

**4** [Fulltext service](#Fulltext-service) fulltext search engine backed by fulltext mongoDb index (port 82)

**5** [Geospacial search service](#Geospacial-search-service) geospacial search service that supports adding places, and quering the placing by coordonates and distance (port 83)

If you consider this demo usefull please consider to give it a star so other will find it quicker :)

## Technollogies involved
* [Docker](https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker) A container system

* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) Docker containers orchestraion system

* [python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/) Programming language

* [MongoDb] (https://www.mongodb.com/) General purpose NoSQL database system

* [flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org/) Python web framework 

* [Mosquitto MQTT] (https://mosquitto.org/) MQTT server

* [Curl] (https://curl.haxx.se/) Linux tool for performing HTTP requests

* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) A tool for documention HTTP requests for using OpenAPI specification: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification

* How to install docker: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04
* How to install docker compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/


## Run the microservice
Before running check that the ports are available and free on your machine!

````
docker-compose up
````

## Testing the architecture
For all HTTP requests we'll be using [curl][https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html]
An alternative to manual HTTP testing you could use Swagger, for example for crud operations in a browser open: 
http://localhost:81/apidocs to see the Swagger UI and to perform test requests from there!

To load the test data i provided, you can use mongorestore after starting the services like this:
````
cd project directory
mongorestore -d demo ./resources/demo/
````


For the MQTT application we'll use mosquitto cli
In most UNIX systems curl is already installed, to install mosquitto cli use:
````
sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients
````


# Random service

The random number collection has only one documents with '_is' lasts
and an "items" key that will be a capped array
MongoDb official documentation (array operations): https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/slice/
* Generate a random number between 10 and 100: 
````
curl -i "http://localhost/random/10/100"
````

* View last 5 generated numbers list: 

````
curl -i "http://localhost/random-list"
````

# CRUD service

The user collections contains _id which is the userid, a name and a email:


* PUT request, this request will add a user with a userid, name and email:

example: add a new user with name dan email test@yahoo.com and userid 189
````
curl -X PUT -d email=test@yahoo.com -d name=dan http://localhost:81/users/189
````

* POST request, this request will modify a user name or email or both:

example, modify the email of the user with id 10

````
curl -X POST -d email=test22@yahoo.com  http://localhost:81/users/10

````

* GET request, this request will output as json the id, name and email of the user

example for with id 1:
````
curl -i "http://localhost:81/users/1"
````

* DELETE request, this request will delete a user with a specified id

example for with id 1:
````
curl -X DELETE -i "http://localhost:81/users/1"
````

# MQTT service

* To update a sensor with id: "some_sensor" and value "some_value" use:

````
mosquitto_pub -h localhost  -p 1883  -d -t some_sensor -m some_value
````
This will publish to mosquitto in a topic named "some_sensor" and value "some_value".

Our python script will listen to this topic too, and save in the mongo sensors collections
the value for the sensor in a capped array.

After it writes the new values, it reads the last 5 values and computes an average (running average)
and publish it to topic "average/some_sensor"

* To get updates for sensor "some_sensor" use:
````
mosquitto_sub -h localhost  -p 1883 -d -t some_sensor
````
This will just listen for updates for the topic "some_sensor"

* To get updates for the average 5 values for sensor "some_sensor" use:
````
mosquitto_sub -h localhost  -p 1883 -d -t averages/some_sensor
````

This will just listen for updates for the topic "averages/some_sensor" and get a running average 
for the sensor "some_sensor". Each time someone publishes a new value for a sensor, the 
python script will calculate the average values of last 5 values and publishes it


# Fulltext service

This service exposes a REST API for inserting a text into the full text database, and retriving last 10 matches
MongoDb official documentation (text search): https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/text-search/
* To index a new expression like "ana has many more apples":
````
curl -X PUT -d expression="ana has many more apples"  http://localhost:82/fulltext
````

* To get all indexed expressions containing word "who"
````
curl -i "http://localhost:82/search/who"
````

# Geospacial search service

The service will allow to insert locations with coordonats (latitude and longitude), and will expose an REST API
to all locations near a point.

MongoDb official documentation(geospacial index): https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/geospatial-queries/

* To add a location named "Bucharest" with latitude 26.1496616 and longitude 44.4205455
````
curl -X POST -d name=Bucharest -d lat="26.1496616" -d lng="44.4205455"  http://localhost:5000/location
````

* To get all locations near 26.1 latitude and 44.4 longitude in a range of 5000 meeters (5 km)
````
curl -i "http://localhost:83/location/26.1/44.4?max_distance=50000"
````
